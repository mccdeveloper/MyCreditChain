    - MCCToken has functionalities for token distribution and blocking token transfer handled by Crowdsale contract
    - Blocking token transfer that locks MCC token of specific token owener is added to prevent unfortunate accident like hacking
    - MCCToken contract also applies "MultiOwnable" to prevent that fund is abused by a specified person

        3. **decimals** - number of digits the cryptocurrency has after the decimal point (ERC20 option)

    - Functions:

        1. **issue(address _to, uint256 _value) external  onlyOwner canIssue** - CCToken can not issue but it need to distribute tokens to contributors while crowding sales. So. we changed this Issue tokens to specified wallet
        2. **destroy(address _from, uint256 _value) external** - Destroy tokens on specified address (Called by owner or token holder). Fund contract address must be in the list of owners to recall token during refund
        3. **increaseApproval(address _spender, uint _addedValue) public returns (bool)** - Increase the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender. approve should be called when allowed[_spender] == 0.
